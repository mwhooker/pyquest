NEXT:
    Curses Improvements.
      Needs scrolling/pads

TODO:

  FUN:
    AI improvement
      respawn 
        zone looks at spawn.respawn on add_spawn.
        if dead, schedule respawn.
        scheduler mixin?


  BIG:
    multiplayer
        clients will simply pass input and render screen
        server will handle all logic.
    ui
    inventory
    spells
    items
    skills
    game mechanics
        stats, etc.
        add randomness to stat exchange
    ray casting (so can't see through walls.)
    rewrite enemy AI so that it's not ghetto
        (i.e. one action at a time. in a loop on tick)
    simple factions (guards shouldn't attack players, but other mobs.)

  PERFORMANCE:
    routing too slow.
    noise function could be multiprocess. low priority.

  TINY:
    auto attack
    mobs shouldn't attack characters that are too high a level
    waypoints
      list of waypoints.
      chase next waypoint.
      (move_to faraway coord function?

DONE
  terrain
    each server will have randomly generated world/terrain, but it will be constant after
    set number of zones, connections, and type (wilderness, city, dungeon)
    TODO DONE line x line review of port. (should output be (-1, 1)?)
    TOOO pythonize

BUGS:

NOTES:
    each instance of the server will host 1 zone.
    servers will need to pass characters from one to the other.
