NEXT:
    terrain
      each server will have randomly generated world/terrain, but it will be constant after
      set number of zones, connections, and type (wilderness, city, dungeon)
      line x line review of port.
      pythonize

TODO:

  FUN:
    AI improvement
      respawn 
        zone looks at spawn.respawn on add_spawn.
        if dead, schedule respawn.
        scheduler mixin?
      waypoints
        list of waypoints.
        chase next waypoint.
        (move_to faraway coord function?
        

  BIG:
    multiplayer
        clients will simply pass input and render screen
        server will handle all logic.
    ui
    inventory
    spells
    items
    skills
    game mechanics
        stats, etc.
    ray casting (so can't see through walls.)
    rewrite enemy AI so that it's not ghetto
        (i.e. one action at a time. in a loop on tick)
    simple factions (guards shouldn't attack players, but other mobs.)

  PERFORMANCE:
    routing too slow.

  TINY:
    auto attack
    add randomness to stat exchange
    mobs shouldn't attack characters that are too high a level

BUGS:
    Needs scrolling/pads

NOTES:
    each instance of the server will host 1 zone.
    servers will need to pass characters from one to the other.
