  FUN:
    AI improvement
      respawn 
        zone looks at spawn.respawn on add_spawn.
        if dead, schedule respawn.
        scheduler mixin?
      waypoints
        list of waypoints.
        chase next waypoint.
        (move_to faraway coord function?
        

  BIG:
    multiplayer
    terrain
    ui
    inventory
    spells
    items
    skills
    ray casting (so can't see through walls.)
    rewrite enemy AI so that it's not ghetto
        (i.e. one action at a time. in a loop on tick)

    PERFORMANCE:
        routing too slow.

  TINY:
    auto attack
    add randomness to stat exchange

BUGS:
    can overrun boundaries. Needs scrolling/pads
